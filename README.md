# IPL-database

Have you have watched this really awesome movie called Moneyball? If you didnâ€™t, you definitely should because it points out the importance of statistics 
and structured data analysis, and this alone made a down-falling team to win the American Baseball League. My project has a similar approach towards 
sports management (particularly IPL). This is an SQL based project, which involves the simulation of the management of the teams and resources of the Indian Premier League. 

Bottomline:
Done as a part of the course "Database Management System"
